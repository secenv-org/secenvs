# secenvs

**Make `.env` secure again. Commit to GitHub without fear.**

secenvs encrypts your environment variables so you can safely commit them to version control. It's `.env` you
can actually share—without the security headaches.

## Why secenvs?

- **Zero wrapper needed** — Import and use secrets directly in your code
- **Team-friendly** — Peer-to-peer encryption for multiple recipients
- **Cross-project vault** — Share shared secrets (like Stripe/AWS keys) across all your projects
- **Lightning fast** — Cold start <50ms, cached access <1ms
- **Battle-tested encryption** — AEAD encryption via [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)
- **CI/CD ready** — Works seamlessly with GitHub Actions and other pipelines
- **Defense-first** — Private fields prevent memory-scanning attacks

## Quick Start

### Runtime

Support for **Node.js** and **Bun**.

```bash
# Install
npm install secenvs

# Initialize (one-time setup)
npx secenvs init

# Add a secret
npx secenvs set API_KEY "your-secret-key"

# Use in code
import { env } from 'secenvs';

const apiKey = await env.API_KEY;
```

## CLI Commands

You can run commands directly with `npx secenvs <command>` or by installing globally.

```bash
secenvs init              # Initialize identity and project
secenvs set KEY VALUE     # Set a secret (encrypted)
secenvs get KEY           # Get a secret (decrypted)
secenvs list              # List all keys
secenvs rotate KEY        # Rotate a secret
secenvs delete KEY        # Delete a secret
secenvs trust PUBKEY      # Add a team member (recipient)
secenvs untrust PUBKEY    # Remove a team member
secenvs vault <cmd>       # Global vault (set, get, list, delete)
secenvs migrate [file]    # Migrate an existing .env file
secenvs run -- <cmd>      # Inject secrets into any subprocess (Python, Go, etc.)
secenvs install-hooks     # Install git pre-commit hooks to block plaintext .env files
secenvs uninstall-hooks   # Remove the git pre-commit hooks
secenvs doctor            # Verify setup and encryption
secenvs key export        # Export private key for CI
```

## SDK Usage

### Proxy-Based Access

The `env` export is a **Proxy object**. It:

1. Intercepts property access (e.g., `env.API_KEY`)
2. Checks `process.env` first (high priority)
3. Falls back to encrypted values in `.secenvs` (low priority)
4. Throw if the key is missing entirely (strict mode)

```typescript
import { env } from "secenvs"

// Access like a normal object property
const dbUrl = await env.DATABASE_URL
const apiKey = await env.API_KEY
```

### Fallback to process.env

The SDK checks `process.env` first, then falls back to your `.secenvs` file:

```typescript
// In production, set DATABASE_URL in your deployment platform
// Locally, use .secenvs
const dbUrl = await env.DATABASE_URL
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
import { env, SecretNotFoundError } from "secenvs"

try {
   const key = await env.MISSING_KEY
} catch (e) {
   if (e instanceof SecretNotFoundError) {
      console.error("Secret not found in .secenvs")
   }
}
```

### Schema Validation (Zod)

`secenvs` provides built-in support for validating your environment at runtime using Zod. This guarantees type
safety and catches missing configuration immediately.

```bash
# Zod is an optional peer dependency
npm install zod
```

```typescript
import { z } from "zod"
import { createEnv } from "secenvs"

// Define your schema (z.object is required)
const schema = z.object({
   DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
   PORT: z.coerce.number().default(3000),
   NODE_ENV: z.enum(["development", "production", "test"]).default("development"),
})

// Eagerly decrypt and validate.
// 'env' is fully typed and synchronous going forward!
export const env = await createEnv(schema)

// Use fully typed variables safely
console.log(`Starting server on port ${env.PORT} in ${env.NODE_ENV}`)
```

Set `{ strict: false }` to handle the `SafeParseReturnType` manually instead of throwing an error:
`await createEnv(schema, { strict: false })`

### Programmatic API

```typescript
import { createSecenv } from "secenvs"

const sdk = await createSecenv()
await sdk.set("API_KEY", "secret-value")
const value = await sdk.get("API_KEY")
```

## The `.secenvs` File

Store secrets in `.secenvs` in your project root:

```env
# Encrypted values (auto-decrypted)
API_KEY=enc:age:AGE-SECRET-KEY-1XYZ...

# Plaintext values (non-sensitive config)
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

Use `--base64` flag for binary values like certificates:

```bash
secenvs set TLS_CERT --base64 < server.crt
```

## Team Sharing (Multi-Recipient)

`secenvs` supports **Multi-Recipient Encryption**. This means you can encrypt secrets so that multiple team
members can decrypt them with their own unique private keys.

### Adding a Team Member

```bash
# Get your colleague's age public key
secenvs trust age1pjh...

# This adds the key to .secenvs as metadata and
# re-encrypts all project secrets for both of you.
```

### Removing a Team Member

```bash
secenvs untrust age1pjh...
```

The `.secenvs` file (containing encrypted secrets and recipient metadata) is committed to your repository so
the project always knows who is authorized to manage secrets.

## Global Vault (Cross-Project Secrets)

Stop copy-pasting your Stripe API key into every project. Store it once in your **Global Vault** and reference
it anywhere.

### 1. Store a global secret

```bash
secenvs vault set STRIPE_KEY "sk_live_..."
```

### 2. Reference it in your project

In your project's `.secenvs` or `.env` file:

```env
# .secenvs
STRIPE_API_KEY=vault:STRIPE_KEY
```

### 3. Automatic Resolution

The SDK resolves `vault:` references at runtime. It's completely transparent to your code:

```typescript
const stripeKey = await env.STRIPE_API_KEY // Returns the decrypted value from the vault
```

The vault is stored at `~/.secenvs/vault.age` and is encrypted specifically for your local identity. It never
leaves your machine.

## Polyglot Support (Non-JS Languages)

`secenvs` isn't just for Node.js. Use the native cross-platform CLI runner to seamlessly inject decrypted
secrets into **any** subprocess, script, or language (Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, Docker).

```bash
secenvs run -- python app.py
secenvs run -- go run main.go
secenvs run -- npm run dev
```

Under the hood, `secenvs` securely spawns the process with the decrypted values injected straight into memory.
Your code simply reads from standard environment variables (e.g., `os.environ['API_KEY']`), keeping your
non-JS codebase 100% wrapper-free.

## Git Hook Safety Net

Never accidentally commit a plaintext `.env` file to your repository again.

```bash
# Install the secenvs pre-commit hook
secenvs install-hooks

# To remove the hook later
secenvs uninstall-hooks
```

This installs a lightweight, native Git pre-commit hook that actively scans your commits and blocks the
transaction if it detects any hardcoded `.env` files trying to leak into your Git history.

## Migration Engine

If you have an existing project with a `.env` file, `secenvs` makes it incredibly easy to migrate to our
encrypted `.secenvs` format.

```bash
# Interactive migration
secenvs migrate

# Migrate a specific file
secenvs migrate .env.local

# Dry run (see what would change without actually writing to disk)
secenvs migrate --dry-run
```

The migration engine will parse your existing file, prompt for how you want to handle each key (e.g. encrypt
it, ignore it, or move it to plaintext config), and safely output the secure `.secenvs` file.

## CI/CD Integration

### 1. Export your identity

```bash
secenvs key export
```

### 2. Add to CI secrets

Add the output as `SECENV_ENCODED_IDENTITY` in your CI provider (GitHub Secrets, etc.).

### 3. Use in CI

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run app
  env:
     SECENV_ENCODED_IDENTITY: ${{ secrets.SECENV_ENCODED_IDENTITY }}
  run: npm run start
```

## Security

- **AEAD encryption** — Each secret is encrypted separately with age
- **Private fields** — JavaScript private class fields protect against memory-scanning
- **Constant-time lookups** — Prevents timing attacks
- **Symlink protection** — Blocks symlink attacks

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- No external dependencies (age encryption bundled)
