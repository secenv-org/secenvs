# secenvs Code of Conduct

## The "Breeze" Philosophy

**secenvs** is built on the philosophy of "security without the ceremony." We value lightweight, fast, and intensely focused engineering. This community is designed for solo developers and small teams who want to build great things without tripping over red tape.

Our code of conduct reflects this philosophy. We do not have a massive, corporate rulebook or a multi-layered moderation committee. We have a few simple, common-sense rules.

## The Rules

1. **Keep it Technical, Keep it Focused**
   We are here to build the best, lowest-friction secret management tool in the world. Discussions in issues, PRs, and community spaces should remain tightly focused on technical implementation, design, and user experience. 

2. **Be Pragmatic and Direct**
   We value brutal honesty about code, but zero tolerance for personal attacks. Critique the implementation, not the person. If code is bad, say *why* it's bad technically. Don't waste time dancing around the issue, but don't use directness as an excuse to be mean.

3. **Assume Good Intent**
   Developers come from all backgrounds and skill levels. If someone submits a buggy PR or asks a question that seems obvious to you, assume they are acting in good faith. Help them out or move on.

4. **Don't Be a Jerk**
   No harassment, discrimination, trolling, or abusive language of any kind. We do not tolerate behavior that makes others feel unwelcome based on who they are.

## Enforcement

There is no complex enforcement ladder. If you are disruptive, hostile, or actively degrade the quality of the project or the community, the maintainers will warn you. If the behavior continues—or is egregious enough on the first offense—you will be blocked from the repository.

**Maintainers have the final say**. We reserve the right to close PRs, lock issues, or block users to keep the project moving fast, keeping the community healthy, and protecting the maintainers' bandwidth.

*This project favors shipping and doing the right thing over endless debate.*
